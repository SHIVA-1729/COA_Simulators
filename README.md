# Computer Architecture Simulators


A collection of C++ tools to visualize low-level hardware logic, built to accompany the Computer System Architecture (Morris Mano) curriculum.

## 🛠 Modules
### 1. Memory Hierarchy (cache_sim.cpp)
   Simulates Direct Mapped cache behavior.

  Visualizes Hit/Miss logic and Conflict Misses.

### 2. Computer Arithmetic (adder_sim.cpp, booths_sim.cpp)

 **Adder Race:** 
  Compares Gate Delays of Ripple Carry vs. Carry Lookahead adders.

 **Booth's Multiplier:**
  Step-by-step trace of Signed Multiplication with visual Arithmetic Shifts.

 **Bit-Pair Recoding:** 
  Automates Radix-4 Booth's recoding for high-speed multiplication.
